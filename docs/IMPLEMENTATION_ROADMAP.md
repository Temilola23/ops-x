    },
    "Backend": {
        "allowed": ["app/api/**/*", "backend/**/*", "*.config.js"],
        "blocked": ["components/**/*.tsx", "*.css"]
    }
}

def can_edit_file(stakeholder_role, file_path):
    # Pattern matching logic

#   "confidence": 0.95,
#   "reasoning": "UI-focused request, V0 is optimal"
# }
```

---

**Your Task:**
- [ ] Just expose `v0_chat_id` in API response
- [ ] Store new `v0_chat_id` after refinement
- [ ] No backend V0 logic needed!

---

#### 4.3 Gemini Fallback (15 min)

---

#### 5.3 Auto-Merge or Re-Refine (30 min)
**Your Task:**
- [ ] If severity < 5: Auto-merge PR
- [ ] If severity 5-7: Flag for review
- [ ] If severity > 7: Re-refine with feedback

**Logic:**
```python
if coderabbit_score < 5:
    github_client.merge_pr(pr_url)

        "project_id": 1,
        "team_members": [...],

## 🚨 WHAT'S MISSING / RISKS

### What You're Downselling (Good Things!)
1. **Real-time Collaboration**: You don't need WebSockets for MVP
   - Polling every 5s is fine for chat
   - Reduces complexity significantly

2. **Advanced JLLM Features**: Start simple
   - Basic Q&A is enough
   - Don't need task auto-assignment yet

### What's Wrong (Need to Fix)
1. **Document Parsing**: You mentioned document ingestion
   - Need a plan for extracting requirements from PDFs/Docs
   - Suggestion: Use Claude's vision API or simple text extraction

2. **File Size Limits**: GitHub has limits
   - Need to handle large repos
   - Consider caching strategy

3. **CodeRabbit Costs**: Check their pricing
   - Auto-reviews might cost money
   - May need fallback to manual review

### What You're Missing
1. **Conflict Resolution**: What if two people refine simultaneously?
   - Solution: Lock files during refinement
   - Or: Use optimistic locking

2. **Version History**: Users might want to revert refinements
   - Solution: Git branches handle this naturally
   - Just need UI to view PR history

3. **Testing**: No mention of tests
   - Solution: Add basic integration tests
   - CodeRabbit can help catch bugs

---

## 🏆 SOPHISTICATION LEVEL

### What Makes This INCREDIBLE:

1. **Multi-Agent AI System**
   - Not just one AI, but intelligent routing
   - Each agent specialized for its task
   - Fetch.ai orchestrates everything

2. **Role-Based Security**
   - File-level permissions
   - Prevents accidental breaking changes
   - Production-grade access control

3. **Auto-Review & Self-Healing**
   - CodeRabbit catches issues
   - System re-refines automatically
   - Minimal human intervention needed

4. **Contextual Continuity**
   - V0 SDK maintains conversation history
   - JLLM remembers project context
   - Chroma provides semantic search

5. **Full Git Workflow**
   - Branches, PRs, reviews
   - Not just a toy - real collaboration
   - Production-ready practices

```

### Step 3: Start Sprint 1 (Now!)
Begin with GitHub code fetching:

2. Create `/api/projects/{id}/code/latest` endpoint
3. Test with Postman
4. Move to next task
